# A simple FastAPI/Plotly/Heroku app

I followed the [Getting started on Heroku with Python tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to create this app.

I then replaced the Django app with a FastAPI/Plotly app. The app provides a simple interface for investigating the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).

I believe that one should be able to more-or-less follow the above-linked Heroku tutorial, but cloning this repository in place of the [python-getting-started](https://github.com/heroku/python-getting-started) repository during the [Prepare the app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#prepare-the-app) stage.
